# phytoclass

The *phytoclass* package uses non-negative matrix factorization and simulated annealing to determine the biomass of different phytoplankton groups from pigment concentrations. 

## Installation

It can be installed from CRAN with:

```r
install.packages("phytoclass")
```

Or the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AndyMcKenzieFromNZ/phytoclass")
```

## Example

For the built-in samples matrix Sm of pigment samples:

```{r example}
library(phytoclass)
set.seed("84545")

Results <- simulated_annealing(Sm, niter = 5)

Results$RMSE
Results$MAE
Results$Error
Results$`F matrix`
Results$`Class abudances`
Results$Figure
```
